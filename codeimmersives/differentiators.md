# Code Immersives Differentiators

### Taking A More Aggressive Approach
* Don't Go To A Bootcamp
    * Shallow And Narrow Vs. Deep and Broad
        * Or:
            * A 3-Month Course Is Not An Education
            * Teaching Fast Makes Shallow Students
        * Concepts that require time and repetition get neither.
        * The more time you spend on a topic, the better your understanding will be.
        * Understanding of a concept often requires understanding of a previous concept.
        * Some topics aren't covered much at all in bootcamps.
            * Like:
                * How to use BASH to work with a filesystem, yours or others.
                * Responsive design, which had _one day_ at my bootcamp.
                * HTML and CSS, which wasn't covered _at all_ at my bootcamp.
            * This gives a huge advantage to those who already have some experience in these topics.
                * That advantage exacerbates the education gap, requiring they already have those previous concepts and can quickly move on to new material.
                * This also has the effect of juicing bootcamps' grad stats--those who graduate tend to be those who already had coding experience, turning junior developers into senior developers.
                    * That's not what bootcamps advertise!
        * Learning how to code five things isn't as valuable as learning how to code.

### Potential Headings/Subheadings

* "Move Fast And Break Things" Is Not An Educational Strategy
* Learning Fast Means Learning Shallow
* On Shallow Vs. Deep Educations
* A 3-Month Course Can't Be A Full Education
* Level 2-3 Is Easy, Level 1-2 Is Where The Learning Happens
